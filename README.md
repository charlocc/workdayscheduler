# Work Day Scheduler


## by Charlotte Clark

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


## Acceptance Criteria
When you open the planner, the current date and time is displayed at the top.
When you scroll down, you will see timeblocks corresponding with standard business hours.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 
* Past = gray
* Present = red
* Future = green
You can type in the time blocks and hit the save button to save that event in that time block. 
To clear that event, just delete the text and save again.
